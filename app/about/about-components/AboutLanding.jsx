      <div>
        NTU MJ Hip Hop Dance Club, also known as MJ, is one of the few pioneer
        dance societies in Singapore. The club's name originated from their
        previous direction of Modern Jazz. Over the years and evolution of their
        members, they have come to adopt Hip Hop as their primary genre of
        dance. In respecting the club's tradition and rich history, they have
        kept their unique name to remind their members of their roots. Nowadays,
        the club is known more affectionately in the Singapore dance scene as
        MJ. Dedicated in being a family, they strive to unite, love and embrace
        one another despite differences, at the same time, retaining diversity
        and uniqueness amongst members. Despite being managed entirely by the
        students, they aim to balance their studies while keeping the passion
        for dance burning. In pursuit of excellence, their humility and
        discipline are traits they take along with them through life. They
        believe strongly that dance has a great power to nurture, inspire and
        change lives, and they do just that, one dance at a time.
